# Events-management

A C++ software application that manages events. 

It can be used in two modes: administrator and user. 
It provides a graphical user interface (done using QT). 

A user can view events from a chosen month and can add or remove them from their watch list. They can also choose to display their list as a csv file or a html one. 
The administrator can add, delete or update events and view a bar chart that displays the number of users that added the events to their list, per event.
